# Biology


The biology module of [eds-scikit](https://github.com/aphp/eds-scikit) supports data scientists working on biological data. Its main objectives are to:

- Provide predefined biology __concept sets__ based on AP-HP coding system
- Facilitate __codes mapping__ between different terminologies and referentials
- Provide data __visualization tools__ and __statistic summary__
- Allows __automatic units__ conversion from heterogenous units system
