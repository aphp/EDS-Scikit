# Vocabulary

A vocabulary is a terminology system that associates a code to a specific clinical event. One may distinguish two types of vocabularies:

## Source vocabulary

The source vocabulary is the vocabulary used in the LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) software. It is specific to the LIMS and may be different in each laboratory.

## Standard vocabulary

The standard vocabulary is a unified vocabulary that allows data analysis on a larger scale.

- It is classified in chapter.
- It has a bigger granularity than the source vocabulary, multiple source codes may be associated to one standard code.
